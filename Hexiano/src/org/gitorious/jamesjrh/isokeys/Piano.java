Zenph Studios Yamaha Disklavier Pro Piano Multisamples for OLPC:

A collection of Grand Piano samples played by a Yamaha Disklavier
Pro. Performed by computer and specifically recorded for OLPC by
Dr. Mikhail Krishtal, Director of Music Research and Production, and
his team at Zenph Studios. They are included in the OLPC sound
sample library.

How is it being done: "The Disklavier Pro has an internal
electronically-controlled mechanism that allows it to play sounds
with very precise specifications. It has its own file format known
as XP MIDI, an extension of standard midi. I Mikhail Krishtal
prepare the files for it to play -- in this case, representing notes
of different registers, durations, and dynamic levels."

Produced by Zenph Studios in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The main
studio location is in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Samples from the OLPC sound sample library:

This huge collection of new and original samples have been donated
to Dr. Richard Boulanger @ cSounds.com specifically to support the
OLPC developers, students, XO users, and computer and electronic
musicians everywhere. They are FREE and are offered under a CC-BY
license.
